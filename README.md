## Description

This module will allow you to easily add Nivo Sliders to your current PyroCMS website. This module utilizes the core Files module to manage images. The Slider widget includes most of the Nivo Slider's javascript options, and we'll hopefully see it extended in the future!

## Installation

Rename the **pyrocms-module-sliders** folder -> **sliders** and drop it into your **addons/shared_addons/modules** directory, then install via the Addons section in the control panel!

### Important
The slider widget currently utilize a path that points to the **addons/shared_addons/modules** directory. If you'd like to use the **addons/default/modules** directory instead, you'll have to modify the included slider widget's run() method.*
